Read this file to get the webhook URL, then POST Adaptive Card JSON to it.

```powershell
$webhookUrl = (Get-Content "$env:USERPROFILE\.squad\teams-webhook.url" -Raw).Trim()
$body = @{ text = "📰 **BREAKING:** Your news here" } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $webhookUrl -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body $body
```

Or use a modern messaging API if available in your agent session.

## Message Style

Use Adaptive Cards or rich markdown with:
- 📰 News header banner
- Section dividers (━━━)
- Emoji categories (🟢 Done, 🟡 In Progress, 🔴 Blocked)
- Pull quotes for key decisions
- Stats counters for metrics
- "Reporter sign-off" personality touch
